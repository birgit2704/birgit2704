- 👋 Hi, I’m @birgit2704. I discovered just recently how much I enjoy coding. This encouraged me to seek a career change after working for 
many years in administrative jobs. I started my journey with a specialization in Web Design. Currently, I am working on a specialization on 
JavaScript. Next I am planning to do a course on Full Stack Development and then I start to look for a job as a Web Developer. Planning is 
April 2023. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

- 👀 I’m interested in finding ways for children to learn effortlessly (especially for subjects they don't like at school). I have a son who 
is my test pupil whether he likes it or not...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript Prototypes and Regular Expressions.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future on Web and App Development.
