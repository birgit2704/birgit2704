- 👋 Hi, I’m @birgit2704. I discovered just recently how much I enjoy coding. This encouraged me to seek a career change after working for 
many years in administrative jobs. I started my journey with a specialization in Web Design and JavaScript. Currently, I am doing the META Front-End Developer specialization. Once I have obtained that, I will start to look for a job as a Frontend Developer. Planning is 
May 2023. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

- 👀 I’m interested in finding ways for children to learn effortlessly (especially for subjects they don't like at school). I have a son who 
is my test pupil whether he likes it or not...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Git and GitHub.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future on Web and App Development.
